        We generally come across hundreds of advertising messages everyday, which tell us about various products such as toilet soaps, detergent powder, soft drinks and services such as hotels, insurance policies, etc. Advertising is perhaps the most commonly used tool of promotion.
        Advertising is an impersonal form of communication, which is paid for by the marketers (sponsors) to promote their products.
        The most common modes of advertising are 'newspapers', 'magazines, 'television', and 'radio".
        Features of Advertising:-
        <br>
        (i) Paid Form: Advertising is a paid form of communication. That is, the sponsor has to bear the cost of communicating with the prospective buyers.
        <br>
        (ii) Impersonal: There is no direct face-to-face contact between the prospective buyers and the advertiser. It is, therefore, referred to as impersonal method of promotion. Advertising creates a monologue and not a dialogue.
        <br>
        (iii) Identified Sponsor: Advertising is undertaken by some identified individual or company, who makes the
        advertising efforts and also bears the cost of it.</p></font>
