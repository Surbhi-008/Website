      <font><font color="red"><p style="font-size:50px">1. Needs and Wants : <br>
        The process of marketing helps individuals and groups in obtaining what they need and want. Thus, the primary reason or motivation for people to engage in the process of marketing is to satisfy some of their needs or wants.
        In other words, the focus of the marketing process is on satisfaction of the needs and wants of individuals and organisations.
        A marketer's job in an organisation is to identify needs of the target customers and develop products and services that satisfy such needs.
        <br>
        2. Creating a market offering:
        <br>
        Market offering refers to a complete offer for a product or service, having given features like size, quality, taste, etc. at a certain price; available at a given outlet or location and so on. For example, offering a cell phone, with good size of memory (say, 16 GB), television viewing, internet, camera, etc. for a given price, say 710,000, available for sale at the firm's exclusive shops in and around all metropolitan cities in the country.
        A good 'market offering is the one which is developed after analysing needs and preferences of the potential
        buyers.
        <br>
        3. Customer value:
        <br>
        The process of marketing facilitates exchange of goods and services between the buyers and the sellers. The buyers, however, will purchase a product only if it is perceived to be giving greatest benefit or value for the money. The purpose of marketing is to generate customer value at a profit.
        The job of a marketer, therefore, is to add to the value of the product so that the customers prefer it in relation to the competing products and decide to purchase it.
        <br>
        4. Exchange mechanism:
        <br>

Exchange is, therefore, referred to as the essence of marketing.
        For any exchange to take place, it is important that the following conditions are satisfied:
        <br>
        (i) Involvement of at least two parties viz. the buyer and the seller.
        ( Each party should be capable of offering something of valice to the other. For example, the seller offers a
        product and the buyer, money.
        <br>
        (ii) Each party should have the ability to communicate and deliver the product or service. No exchange can take place if the buyers and sellers are not able to communicate with each other or if they cannot deliver something of value to the other.
        <br>
        (iii) Each party should have freedom to accept or reject the other party's offer.
        <br>
        (iv) The parties should be willing to enter into transactions with each other. Thus, the acceptance or rejection of the offer takes place on voluntary basis rather than on the basis of any compulsion.
